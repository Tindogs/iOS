# TINDOGS iOS
## Notes for the instructor

- We use firebase storage to store all the images, so you will need our GoogleService-Info.plist, you can contact us via slack and we will email it to you.
- Coordinates are Hardcoded because we want to obtain a lot of dogs at our backend requests, but the real working code is just above the hardcoded one.
